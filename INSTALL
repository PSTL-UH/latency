Installing latency is straight forward. Please run the configure
script, specifying as a minimum the directory of the MPI library
used. You can view all options with

./configure --help

Then type 

make

or, if you would like to disable some MPI-2 features (e.g.
dynamic communicators, one-sided operations), please type

make nompi2
